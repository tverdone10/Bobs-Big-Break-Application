Bob’s Big Break

Bob’s Big Break is an incremental clicker game in which you’re constantly looking for ways to generate more and more money to purchase stuff that will generate even more money, and cosmetic items that you can put onto your character. 

The basic idea of generating revenue is this -- you’ll have one usable item equipped at a time which you can click on to generate x amount of coins per click (1 coin per click for clicking on a bag of coins, 5 coins per click for clicking on a squeegee, etc…). Likewise, each cosmetic item will have some sort of passive effect on your revenue (if you've purchased the recycling business you get 1 coin per second, or if you’ve got some other business you’ll get +5). There will also be an inventory screen where you can visualize your main character, Bob, wearing the cosmetic items you’ve unlocked, and view the use items you’ve unlocked. 

Once the project is fleshed out, it would be really cool to upscale the item database/databases and have Bob move to different locations that have different item pools. The idea is that eventually, if there are enough items/item pools, people could compare how their characters look and the items they have and get really creative with it.
